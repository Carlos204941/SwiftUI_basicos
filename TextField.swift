/* Understanding TextField in SwiftUI
The TextField in SwiftUI is a control that allows users to input and edit text. 
It is a fundamental component for creating forms and capturing user input.
Let's break down how the TextField works in the provided 
TextFieldBootcamp view and explore its various aspects.

Key Components of TextField
Binding:
The TextField uses a binding to a state variable to keep track of the text input. 
This allows the TextField to update the state variable whenever the user types something.
Placeholder:
The placeholder text is displayed when the TextField is empty. 
It provides a hint to the user about what to type.
Modifiers:
Various modifiers are used to style the TextField, such as padding, 
background, cornerRadius, foregroundColor, and font.
Example: TextFieldBootcamp
Let's analyze the provided TextFieldBootcamp view:*/


import SwiftUI

struct TextFieldBootcamp: View {
    @State private var textFieldText = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        TextField("Type something here...", text: $textFieldText)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
            .cornerRadius(10)
            .foregroundColor(.red)
            .font(.headline)
    }
}

struct TextFieldBootcamp_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        TextFieldBootcamp()
    }
}


/*In this example, we have a TextField with a placeholder text "Type something here..."
and a binding to the state variable textFieldText.
The TextField is styled with padding, background color, corner radius, text color, and font.
When the user types something in the TextField, the textFieldText state variable is updated.
This allows us to access the text input and perform further actions based on it.
Overall, the TextField in SwiftUI is a versatile control that enables users to input text
and interact with the app. By understanding its key components and modifiers,
we can create engaging user interfaces and capture user input effectively.*/


/* Detailed Explanation
State Variable:
@State private var textFieldText = ""
This state variable holds the current text in the TextField. 
The @State property wrapper allows SwiftUI to manage the state and update 
the view when the state changes.
TextField Initialization:
TextField("Type something here...", text: $textFieldText)
The TextField is initialized with a placeholder text "Type something here..." 
and a binding to the textFieldText state variable. The $ symbol is used to pass the binding.
Modifiers:
.padding(): Adds padding around the TextField.
.background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3)): Sets the background color with some transparency.
.cornerRadius(10): Rounds the corners of the TextField.
.foregroundColor(.red): Sets the text color to red.
.font(.headline): Sets the font style to headline.
Customizing TextField
You can further customize the TextField by adding more modifiers or using different initializers. 
Here are some examples:

Adding a Border*/


TextField("Type something here...", text: $textFieldText)
    .padding()
    .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
    .cornerRadius(10)
    .foregroundColor(.red)
    .font(.headline)
    .overlay(
        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10)
            .stroke(Color.blue, lineWidth: 2)
    )


/*This code adds a blue border around the TextField using the overlay modifier.
Changing the Font Style*/

/*Adding a Clear Button
You can add a clear button to the TextField to allow users to clear the text easily: */


import SwiftUI

struct TextFieldBootcamp: View {
    @State private var textFieldText = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            TextField("Type something here...", text: $textFieldText)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
                .cornerRadius(10)
                .foregroundColor(.red)
                .font(.headline)
            
            if !textFieldText.isEmpty {
                Button(action: {
                    textFieldText = ""
                }) {
                    Image(systemName: "xmark.circle.fill")
                        .foregroundColor(.gray)
                }
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}


/*In this code, a clear button is added to the TextField using an if statement.
The button is displayed only when the textFieldText is not empty.
When the button is tapped, the textFieldText is set to an empty string, clearing the text.
This provides a convenient way for users to clear the text input in the TextField.*/


/*Conclusion
The TextField in SwiftUI is a powerful control for capturing user input and creating forms.
By understanding its key components, such as binding, placeholder, and modifiers,
we can create interactive and user-friendly interfaces.
Experiment with different styles, customizations, and interactions to enhance the user experience
and make your app more engaging.*/

/*Handling TextField Events
 */

 TextField("Type something here...", text: $textFieldText, onEditingChanged: { isEditing in
    print("Editing: \(isEditing)")
}, onCommit: {
    print("Commit: \(textFieldText)")
})
.padding()
.background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
.cornerRadius(10)
.foregroundColor(.red)
.font(.headline)


/*In this code, we added two event handlers to the TextField:
onEditingChanged: This closure is called when the editing state of the TextField changes.
It takes a boolean parameter isEditing, which indicates whether the TextField is being edited.
onCommit: This closure is called when the user commits the text input, such as by 
pressing the return key.
It does not take any parameters.
In the event handlers, we print messages to the console to indicate the editing and commit events.
You can use these event handlers to perform actions based on user interactions with the TextField,
such as updating the UI, validating input, or triggering other events.*/


/*Conclusion
By utilizing event handlers like onEditingChanged and onCommit,
you can enhance the functionality of the TextField and create more interactive user experiences.
Experiment with different event-driven behaviors to make your app more dynamic and 
responsive to user input.*/


/*Summary
State Management: The TextField uses a binding to a state variable to manage the text input.
Placeholder: Provides a hint to the user about what to type.
Modifiers: Various modifiers are used to style the TextField.
Customization: You can customize the TextField by adding more modifiers, 
handling events, or adding additional UI elements like clear buttons.
By understanding these components and techniques, 
you can effectively use and customize TextField in 
SwiftUI to create interactive and user-friendly forms [0][1][2][3]*/

/* you can change the keyboard type for a specific TextField in SwiftUI using the 
.keyboardType() modifier. This modifier allows you to specify the type of keyboard 
that should be presented to the user when they interact with the TextField. 
The UIKeyboardType enumeration provides various keyboard types 
that you can use to customize the input experience.

How to Use .keyboardType() Modifier
The .keyboardType() modifier is applied directly to the TextField view. 
You can choose from several predefined keyboard types, such as .default, 
.numberPad, .emailAddress, .phonePad, and more.

Example
Here’s an example demonstrating how to use the .keyboardType() modifier to set 
different keyboard types for different TextField instances:*/


import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var email = ""
    @State private var phoneNumber = ""
    @State private var number = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            // Email TextField
            TextField("Enter your email", text: $email)
                .keyboardType(.emailAddress)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
                .cornerRadius(10)
                .autocapitalization(.none)
                .disableAutocorrection(true)
            
            // Phone Number TextField
            TextField("Enter your phone number", text: $phoneNumber)
                .keyboardType(.phonePad)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
                .cornerRadius(10)
            
            // Number TextField
            TextField("Enter a number", text: $number)
                .keyboardType(.numberPad)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
                .cornerRadius(10)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}


/*In this example, we have three TextField instances with different keyboard types:
The first TextField is for entering an email address, and it uses the .emailAddress keyboard type.
The second TextField is for entering a phone number, and it uses the .phonePad keyboard type.
The third TextField is for entering a number, and it uses the .numberPad keyboard type.
By specifying the appropriate keyboard type for each TextField, you can provide a more
customized input experience for the user.*/


/*Conclusion
The .keyboardType() modifier in SwiftUI allows you to customize the keyboard type
for TextField instances, providing a more tailored input experience for users.
By choosing the appropriate keyboard type based on the expected input, you can

improve usability and make the input process more intuitive and efficient.*/


/*Explanation
Email TextField:
keyboardType(.emailAddress): Sets the keyboard type to an email address keyboard, 
which includes special characters like "@" and ".".
autocapitalization(.none): Disables automatic capitalization.
disableAutocorrection(true): Disables autocorrection.
Phone Number TextField:
keyboardType(.phonePad): Sets the keyboard type to a phone pad, 
which is optimized for entering phone numbers.
Number TextField:
keyboardType(.numberPad): Sets the keyboard type to a number pad, 
which is optimized for entering numeric values.
Common Keyboard Types
Here are some commonly used keyboard types from the UIKeyboardType enumeration:

.default: A standard keyboard with a full character set.
.numberPad: A numeric keypad with digits.
.decimalPad: A numeric keypad with digits and a decimal point.
.emailAddress: A keyboard optimized for entering email addresses.
.phonePad: A numeric keypad optimized for entering phone numbers.
.webSearch: A keyboard optimized for web searches.
Summary
.keyboardType() Modifier: Use this modifier to specify the type of keyboard for a TextField.
UIKeyboardType Enumeration: Provides various keyboard types to customize the input experience.
Example: Demonstrates how to set different keyboard types for different TextField instances.
By using the .keyboardType() modifier, you can enhance the user experience by presenting 
the most relevant keyboard for the given input field, 
making data entry more intuitive and efficient 12345.*/


/*How do I limit the number of characters allowed in a TextField?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
Limiting the Number of Characters in a TextField in SwiftUI
To limit the number of characters allowed in a TextField in SwiftUI, 
you can use a combination of state management and the onReceive modifier. 
This approach ensures that the text input is truncated to the specified limit in real-time.

Example Implementation
Here's a complete example demonstrating how to limit the number of characters in a TextField: */


import SwiftUI
import Combine

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username = ""
    let textLimit = 10 // Your character limit

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Username", text: $username)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
                .cornerRadius(10)
                .onReceive(Just(username)) { _ in limitText(textLimit) }
                .padding()

            Text("Character count: \(username.count)")
                .padding()
        }
        .padding()
    }

    // Function to keep text length within limits
    func limitText(_ upper: Int) {
        if username.count > upper {
            username = String(username.prefix(upper))
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}


/*In this example, we limit the number of characters in the username TextField to 10 characters.
The limitText function is called using the onReceive modifier, which truncates the text input
to the specified limit in real-time. The character count is displayed below the TextField.

Explanation
@State private var username = "": State variable to hold the text input.
let textLimit = 10: Character limit for the TextField.
TextField("Username", text: $username): TextField for entering the username.
.onReceive(Just(username)) { _ in limitText(textLimit) }:
onReceive modifier to call the limitText function when the text changes.
.limitText(_ upper: Int): Function to truncate the text to the specified limit.
Text("Character count: \(username.count)"): Display the character count below the TextField.
By using the onReceive modifier and a custom function to limit the text length,
you can enforce character limits in TextFields in SwiftUI effectively.*/


/*Explanation
State Variable:
@State private var username = "": This state variable holds the current text in the TextField.
TextField Initialization:
TextField("Username", text: $username): The TextField is initialized with a 
placeholder text "Username" and a binding to the username state variable.
Modifiers:
.padding(): Adds padding around the TextField.
.background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3)): Sets the background color with some transparency.
.cornerRadius(10): Rounds the corners of the TextField.
Character Limit:
.onReceive(Just(username)) { _ in limitText(textLimit) }: This modifier listens for 
changes to the username state variable and calls the limitText function 
whenever the text changes.
Limit Text Function:
func limitText(_ upper: Int): This function truncates the text to the specified limit 
if the character count exceeds the limit.
Custom Extension for Reusability
You can create a custom extension to make this functionality reusable across 
different TextField instances: */


import SwiftUI
import Combine

extension View {
    func limitCharacterLength(_ limit: Int, text: Binding<String>) -> some View {
        self
            .onReceive(Just(text.wrappedValue)) { _ in
                if text.wrappedValue.count > limit {
                    text.wrappedValue = String(text.wrappedValue.prefix(limit))
                }
            }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username = ""
    @State private var email = ""
    let usernameLimit = 10
    let emailLimit = 20

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Username", text: $username)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
                .cornerRadius(10)
                .limitCharacterLength(usernameLimit, text: $username)
                .padding()

            TextField("Email", text: $email)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
                .cornerRadius(10)
                .limitCharacterLength(emailLimit, text: $email)
                .padding()

            Text("Username character count: \(username.count)")
                .padding()

            Text("Email character count: \(email.count)")
                .padding()
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}


/*In this example, we create a custom extension on the View protocol to limit the character length
of a TextField. The limitCharacterLength function takes the character limit and a binding to the text
input as parameters. This extension can be used to enforce character limits on multiple TextField instances.

By encapsulating the character limit logic in a reusable extension, you can easily apply this functionality
to different TextFields in your SwiftUI views.*/


/*Conclusion
By combining state management, the onReceive modifier, and a custom function, you can effectively limit
the number of characters allowed in a TextField in SwiftUI. This approach ensures that the text input is
truncated to the specified limit in real-time, providing a seamless user experience.*/

/*Explanation of the Extension
Custom Extension:
extension View { ... }: This extension adds a new method to the View protocol.
func limitCharacterLength(_ limit: Int, text: Binding<String>) -> some View: 
This method takes a character 
limit and a binding to a String and returns a modified view.
Modifier Implementation:
.onReceive(Just(text.wrappedValue)) { _ in ... }: This listens for changes 
to the text and truncates it if it exceeds the specified limit.
Summary
State Management: Use a state variable to hold the text input.
onReceive Modifier: Listen for changes to the text and apply the character limit in real-time.
Custom Extension: Create a reusable extension to apply the character limit to multiple TextField instances.
By following these steps, you can effectively limit the number of characters allowed in a TextField in SwiftUI, 
ensuring a better user experience and maintaining data integrity 12345. */

/* Is it possible to have multiple TextFields within a single form and manage them collectively?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
Managing Multiple TextFields in a Single Form in SwiftUI
Yes, it is possible to have multiple TextField instances within a single 
form and manage them collectively in SwiftUI. This can be achieved using state management, 
focus management, and event handling. Let's explore how to implement this effectively.

Key Concepts
State Management:
Use @State properties to manage the text input for each TextField.
Focus Management:
Use the @FocusState property wrapper to manage the focus between multiple TextField instances.
Event Handling:
Use the onSubmit modifier to handle the return key event and 
switch focus to the next TextField.

/*How do I create a multiline TextField in SwiftUI?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
Creating a Multiline TextField in SwiftUI
To create a multiline TextField in SwiftUI, you can use the TextEditor view, 
which allows users to input and edit multiple lines of text. 
The TextEditor view provides a flexible and customizable way to 
capture multiline text input. Let's explore how to create a multiline TextField using TextEditor.

Example Implementation

Here's a complete example demonstrating how to create a multiline TextField in SwiftUI using TextEditor:*/

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var text = ""

    var body: some View {
        TextEditor(text: $text)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
            .cornerRadius(10)
            .frame(minHeight: 100)
    }
}


struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}


/*In this example, we use the TextEditor view to create a multiline TextField. 
The text input is bound to the state variable text, allowing users to input and 
edit multiple lines of text. The TextEditor is styled with padding, background color, 
corner radius, and a minimum height to accommodate multiline text input.

Explanation
State Variable:
@State private var text = "": State variable to hold the multiline text input.
TextEditor Initialization:
TextEditor(text: $text): TextEditor view for multiline text input, 
bound to the text state variable.
Modifiers:
.padding(): Adds padding around the TextEditor.
.background(Color.gray.opacity(0.3)): Sets the background color with some transparency.
.cornerRadius(10): Rounds the corners of the TextEditor.
.frame(minHeight: 100): Sets a minimum height to accommodate multiline text input.
By using the TextEditor view in SwiftUI, you can easily create multiline TextFields 
for capturing longer text input from users. The TextEditor provides a versatile and 
interactive way to handle multiline text input in your SwiftUI apps.*/


/*How do I validate user input in a TextField before submitting the form?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
Validating User Input in a TextField Before Submitting the Form in SwiftUI
To validate user input in a TextField before submitting a form in SwiftUI, 
you can use a combination of state management, custom validation logic 
and event handling. Below, I'll provide a comprehensive example that demonstrates how 
to validate multiple TextField instances within a form.

Key Concepts

Use @State properties to manage the text input for each TextField.
Validation Logic:
Implement custom validation logic to check the input values.
Event Handling:
Use the onSubmit modifier to handle the return key event and validate the input.
Custom Validation Modifier:
Create a custom view modifier to encapsulate the validation logic.
Example Implementation
Here's a complete example demonstrating how to validate user 
input in multiple TextField instances within a form:

Step 1: Define the Custom Validation Modifier */

import SwiftUI

struct ValidationModifier: ViewModifier {
    let validation: () -> Bool
    @Binding var isValid: Bool

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .onChange(of: validation()) { newValue in
                isValid = newValue
            }
    }
}

extension View {
    func validate(_ validation: @escaping () -> Bool, isValid: Binding<Bool>) -> some View {
        self.modifier(ValidationModifier(validation: validation, isValid: isValid))
    }
}


/*Step 2: Implement the Form with Validations */

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var email: String = ""
    @State private var password: String = ""

                    Text("Submit")
                        .padding()
                        .background(isFormValid ? Color.blue : Color.gray)
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                        .cornerRadius(10)
                }
                .disabled(!isFormValid)
            }
            .navigationTitle("User Form")
        }
    }

    private var isFormValid: Bool {
        return isEmailValid && isPasswordValid && isNameValid && isSurnameValid
    }

    private func submitForm() {
        // Perform form submission actions
        print("Form submitted with email: \(email), name: \(name), surname: \(surname), password: \(password)")
    }
