/*   let's dive deeper into using NavigationView in SwiftUI. I'll provide a c
omprehensive guide on how to create a NavigationView, 
add a title, and include other useful features like navigation bar items and navigation links.

Creating a NavigationView
To create a NavigationView, you simply wrap your content inside the NavigationView container. 
This container provides a navigation bar at the top of the screen. */

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Text("Your Content Here")
                .navigationTitle("Title")
        }
    }
}


/* Adding a Title
You can add a title to the navigation bar using the navigationTitle modifier. 
This title will appear at the top of the screen. */

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Text("Your Content Here")
                .navigationTitle("Title")
        }
    }
}


NavigationView {
    Text("Your Content Here")
        .navigationTitle("Title")
}


/*Adding Navigation Bar Items
You can add items to the navigation bar, such as buttons, 
using the navigationBarItems modifier. This modifier allows you to place items on 
the leading (left) or trailing (right) side of the navigation bar.

Here's an example of adding a button to the leading side of the navigation bar: */

NavigationView {
    Text("Your Content Here")
        .navigationTitle("Title")
        .navigationBarItems(
            leading: Button(action: {
                print("Leading button tapped")
            }) {
                Text("Leading")
            },
            trailing: Button(action: {
                print("Trailing button tapped")
            }) {
                Text("Trailing")
            }
        )
}



/*Using Navigation Links
To navigate between views, you can use NavigationLink. 
This allows you to create a tappable link that navigates to another view. */
 

 struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                    Text("Go to Detail View")
                }
                .navigationTitle("Home")
            }
        }
    }
}

struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("This is the detail view")
            .navigationTitle("Detail")
    }
}


/*In the example above, when the user taps on the "Go to Detail View" text,

it will navigate to the DetailView. The DetailView will have its own title in the navigation bar.

You can also use NavigationLink with a list to create a list of tappable items that navigate to different views. */

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                    Text("Item 1")
                }
                NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                    Text("Item 2")
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("List")
        }
    }
}


/*Customizing Navigation Bar Appearance

You can customize the appearance of the navigation bar using the navigationBarTitleDisplayMode modifier.

This modifier allows you to control how the title is displayed in the navigation bar.

Here are the available display modes:

- .automatic: The title is displayed according to the platform's default behavior.

- .inline: The title is displayed inline with the content.

- .large: The title is displayed in a large format.

Here's an example of using the navigationBarTitleDisplayMode modifier: */

NavigationView {
    Text("Your Content Here")
        .navigationTitle("Title")
        .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
}


/*Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to create a NavigationView, add a title,

include navigation bar items, and use navigation links in SwiftUI.

You also learned how to customize the appearance of the navigation bar.

By mastering these techniques, you can create sophisticated navigation flows in your SwiftUI apps. */



/* Customizing the Navigation Bar
You can further customize the navigation bar using various modifiers. For example, 
you can hide the navigation bar or change its appearance.

Hiding the Navigation Bar: */

NavigationView {
    Text("Your Content Here")
        .navigationTitle("Title")
        .navigationBarHidden(true)
}


/*Changing the Navigation Bar Color:
To change the navigation bar color, you need to use the UINavigationBarAppearance 
API in the UIViewControllerRepresentable protocol.

 */

 struct ContentView: View {
    init() {
        let appearance = UINavigationBarAppearance()
        appearance.configureWithOpaqueBackground()
        appearance.backgroundColor = .systemBlue
        appearance.titleTextAttributes = [.foregroundColor: UIColor.white]
        appearance.largeTitleTextAttributes = [.foregroundColor: UIColor.white]

        UINavigationBar.appearance().standardAppearance = appearance
        UINavigationBar.appearance().scrollEdgeAppearance = appearance
    }

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Text("Your Content Here")
                .navigationTitle("Title")
        }
    }
}


/*In the example above, we create a custom appearance for the navigation 
bar with a blue background color and white text color.

We then set this appearance for both the standard and scroll 
edge appearance of the navigation bar.

This will change the appearance of the navigation bar throughout the app.

Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to further customize the navigation bar in 
SwiftUI by hiding it and changing its appearance.

By using these techniques, you can create a more personalized and visually 
appealing navigation experience for your users. */

/*Can I use NavigationView with custom transitions or animations?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
Custom Transitions in SwiftUI NavigationView
In SwiftUI, the default transition for NavigationView and NavigationLink is a slide animation. 
However, there is no official way to customize this transition directly. To achieve custom transitions, 
you can either create your own navigation system or use third-party libraries like NavigationTransitions.

Using a Custom Navigation System
One approach is to create a custom navigation system using @State and conditional views. 
This allows you to apply any transition you want.

Here's an example of how you can create a custom navigation system with a fade transition: */

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showDetailView = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if showDetailView {
                DetailView()
                    .transition(.opacity)
            } else {
                Button("Go to Detail View") {
                    withAnimation {
                        showDetailView = true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

struct DetailView: View {
    @State private var appeared: Double = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("This is the detail view")
                .opacity(appeared)
                .onAppear {
                    withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 1.0)) {
                        appeared = 1.0
                    }
                }
                .onDisappear {
                    appeared = 0.0
                }
            Button("Go Back") {
                withAnimation {
                    appeared = 0.0
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


/*In this example, we use a @State variable to control the visibility of the DetailView. 
When the user taps the button, the DetailView appears with a fade-in animation.

Using Third-Party Libraries

Another option is to use third-party libraries like NavigationTransitions,

which provide more advanced transition options for NavigationView and NavigationLink.

Conclusion

While SwiftUI does not offer direct customization of NavigationView transitions,

you can create custom transitions using conditional views and animations.

Alternatively, you can explore third-party libraries for more advanced transition options. */


/*How do I navigate back to the previous screen in SwiftUI?

ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL

In SwiftUI, you can navigate back to the previous screen by using the presentationMode environment variable.

This variable allows you to control the presentation mode of a view, including dismissing the current view.

Here's an example of how you can navigate back to the previous screen: */

import SwiftUI


struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("This is the first screen")
            Button("Go to Second Screen") {
                presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()
            }
        }
    }
}



/*In this example, we use the presentationMode environment variable to dismiss the current view when the button is tapped.

This action effectively navigates back to the previous screen.

Conclusion


In SwiftUI, you can navigate back to the previous screen by using the presentationMode 
environment variable and calling the dismiss method.

This allows you to create a seamless navigation experience for your users. */

/*Using NavigationTransitions Library
The NavigationTransitions library allows you to customize transitions in NavigationView and NavigationStack. 
This library provides a simple API to apply custom transitions.

First, add the NavigationTransitions library to your project. 
You can do this by adding the following to your Package.swift file: */

dependencies; [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/davdroman/swiftui-navigation-transitions", from: "1.0.0")

import SwiftUI
import NavigationTransitions

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                Text("Go to Detail View")
            }
            .navigationTitle("Home")
            .navigationTransition(.slide.combined(with: .fade(.in)))
        }
    }
}

struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("This is the detail view")
            .navigationTitle("Detail")
    }
}


/*In this example, we use the NavigationTransitions library to apply a custom slide and fade transition when navigating to the DetailView.

By using this library, you can create more engaging and visually appealing navigation experiences in your SwiftUI apps. */

/*How do I pass data between views in SwiftUI?

ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL

In SwiftUI, you can pass data between views using @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, @EnvironmentObject, and @Environment variables.

Here's an overview of each method:

@State: Use @State to store and manage local state within a view.

@Binding: Use @Binding to pass data between parent and child views bidirectionally.

@ObservedObject: Use @ObservedObject to pass an observable object between views.

@EnvironmentObject: Use @EnvironmentObject to pass an observable object to all views in a view hierarchy.

@Environment: Use @Environment to access system-wide values like color scheme, locale, and presentation mode.

Here's an example of passing data between views using @State and @Binding: */

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var text: String = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Enter text", text: $text)
            ChildView(text: $text)
        }
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    @Binding var text: String

    var body: some View {
        Text("You entered: \(text)")
    }
}


/*In this example, we use @State to store the text entered in a TextField in the ContentView.

We then pass this text to the ChildView using @Binding, allowing the ChildView to display the entered text.

Conclusion

In SwiftUI, you can pass data between views using @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, @EnvironmentObject, and @Environment variables.

By leveraging these tools, you can create dynamic and interactive user interfaces in your SwiftUI apps. */



/*How do I create a custom back button in SwiftUI?

ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL

In SwiftUI, you can create a custom back button by using the navigationBarItems modifier with a leading closure.

This allows you to customize the appearance and behavior of the back button in the navigation bar.

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Text("Your Content Here")
                .navigationTitle("Title")
                .navigationBarItems(leading: CustomBackButton())
        }
    }
}

struct CustomBackButton: View {
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()
        }) {
            Image(systemName: "arrow.left")
        }
    }
}


/*In this example, we create a custom back button using the navigationBarItems modifier with a leading closure.

Conclusion

In SwiftUI, you can create a navigation bar with a search bar by combining a 
NavigationView with a SearchBar view.

By adding search functionality to your navigation bar, you can enhance 
the user experience and make it easier for users to find content in your app. */


/*Creating Custom Transitions
If you want to create entirely custom transitions, you can define your own ViewModifier and 
use it in an AnyTransition extension.

Here's an example of a custom transition that mimics an iris animation:

 */

import SwiftUI

struct ScaledCircle: Shape {
    var animatableData: Double

    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
        let maximumCircleRadius = sqrt(rect.width * rect.width + rect.height * rect.height)
        let circleRadius = maximumCircleRadius * animatableData

        let x = rect.midX - circleRadius / 2
        let y = rect.midY - circleRadius / 2

        let circleRect = CGRect(x: x, y: y, width: circleRadius, height: circleRadius)

        return Circle().path(in: circleRect)
    }
}

struct ClipShapeModifier<T: Shape>: ViewModifier {
    let shape: T

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content.clipShape(shape)
    }
}

extension AnyTransition {
    static var iris: AnyTransition {
        .modifier(
            active: ClipShapeModifier(shape: ScaledCircle(animatableData: 0)),
            identity: ClipShapeModifier(shape: ScaledCircle(animatableData: 1))
        )
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isShowingRed = false

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Color.blue
                .frame(width: 200, height: 200)

            if isShowingRed {
                Color.red
                    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
                    .transition(.iris)
                    .zIndex(1)
            }
        }
        .padding(50)
        .onTapGesture {
            withAnimation(.easeInOut) {
                isShowingRed.toggle()
            }
        }
    }
}


/*In this example, we define a custom ScaledCircle shape that animates its size based on the 
animatableData property.

We then create a ClipShapeModifier that clips the content to the specified shape.

Finally, we define an iris transition using the ClipShapeModifier with different shapes 
for the active and identity states.

When the user taps on the screen, the red square animates in an iris-like fashion.

Conclusion

By creating custom transitions in SwiftUI, you can add unique and engaging animations to your app's navigation flow.

Whether you want to mimic existing transitions or create entirely new ones, 
SwiftUI provides the flexibility to bring your design ideas to life. */


/* Yes, you can use multiple custom transitions within the same app in SwiftUI. 
SwiftUI's flexibility allows you to define and apply different transitions to various views, 
making your app's user interface more dynamic and engaging.

Key Points to Consider
Combining Transitions: You can combine multiple transitions using the combined(with:) method.
Custom Transitions: You can create custom transitions by defining ViewModifier and extending AnyTransition.
Asymmetric Transitions: Use asymmetric transitions to have different animations for insertion and removal.
Reusability: Define transitions as extensions on AnyTransition for easy reuse.
Example: Using Multiple Custom Transitions
Let's create an example where we use multiple custom transitions within the same app. 
We'll define two custom transitions and apply them to different views.

Step 1: Define Custom Transitions
First, we'll define two custom transitions: rotateAndScale and slideAndFade.*/

import SwiftUI

// Custom Rotate and Scale Transition
struct RotateAndScaleModifier: ViewModifier {
    let degree: Double
    let scale: CGFloat

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: degree))
            .scaleEffect(scale)
    }
}

extension AnyTransition {
    static var rotateAndScale: AnyTransition {
        AnyTransition.modifier(
            active: RotateAndScaleModifier(degree: 180, scale: 0.1),
            identity: RotateAndScaleModifier(degree: 0, scale: 1)
        )
    }
}

// Custom Slide and Fade Transition
extension AnyTransition {
    static var slideAndFade: AnyTransition {
        AnyTransition.move(edge: .trailing).combined(with: .opacity)
    }
}


/*In this code snippet, we define two custom transitions: rotateAndScale and slideAndFade.

The rotateAndScale transition rotates the view by 180 degrees and scales it down to 10% of its original size.

The slideAndFade transition moves the view from the trailing edge and fades it in or out.

Step 2: Apply Custom Transitions
Next, we'll apply these custom transitions to different views in our app.*/

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showFirstView = false
    @State private var showSecondView = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Toggle First View") {
                withAnimation {
                    showFirstView.toggle()
                }
            }

            if showFirstView {
                Text("First View")
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.blue)
                    .cornerRadius(10)
                    .transition(.rotateAndScale)
            }

            Button("Toggle Second View") {
                withAnimation {
                    showSecondView.toggle()
                }
            }

            if showSecondView {
                Text("Second View")
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.green)
                    .cornerRadius(10)
                    .transition(.slideAndFade)
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}


/*In this code snippet, we have a ContentView with two buttons to toggle the visibility of two Text views.

When the "Toggle First View" button is tapped, the first Text view appears with the rotateAndScale transition.

When the "Toggle Second View" button is tapped, the second Text view appears with the slideAndFade transition.

Conclusion

You can use multiple custom transitions within the same app in SwiftUI to create engaging and dynamic animations.

By defining and applying custom transitions to different views, 
you can enhance the user experience and make your app more visually appealing. */

/* Summary
In this example, we defined two custom transitions: rotateAndScale and slideAndFade. 
We then applied these transitions to different views within the same ContentView. 
This demonstrates how you can use multiple custom transitions to create a dynamic 
and engaging user interface in SwiftUI.

Best Practices
Reusability: Define custom transitions as extensions on AnyTransition for easy reuse.
Animation Control: Use withAnimation to control the timing and type of animations.
State Management: Use @State to manage the visibility of views and trigger transitions.
By following these practices, you can create a visually 
appealing and user-friendly interface in your SwiftUI app.*/

/*How do I create a navigation bar with a tab bar in SwiftUI?

ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL

In SwiftUI, you can create a navigation bar with a tab bar by combining a NavigationView with a TabView.

Here's an example of how you can create a navigation bar with a tab bar: */



import SwiftUI



struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selectedTab = 0

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            TabView(selection: $selectedTab) {
                Text("Tab 1")

                        Label("Tab 1", systemImage: "1.circle")
                    }

                Text("Tab 2")
                    .tag(1)
                    .tabItem {
                        Label("Tab 2", systemImage: "2.circle")

In SwiftUI, you can create a navigation bar with a tab bar by combining a 
NavigationView with a TabView.

By adding a tab bar to the navigation bar, you can organize and present 
different views or sections of your app in a user-friendly way. */

/*Summary
In this example, we defined two custom transitions: rotateAndScale and slideAndFade. 
We then applied these transitions to different views within the same ContentView. 
This demonstrates how you can use multiple custom transitions to create a dynamic and 
engaging user interface in SwiftUI.

Best Practices
Reusability: Define custom transitions as extensions on AnyTransition for easy reuse.
Animation Control: Use withAnimation to control the timing and type of animations.
State Management: Use @State to manage the visibility of views and trigger transitions.
By following these practices, you can create a visually appealing and user-friendly 
interface in your SwiftUI app. */

.transition(.move(edge: .trailing))


/* Opacity Transition:
Use Case: Subtle content updates, such as showing or hiding additional information.

/*Scale Transition:
Use Case: Emphasizing modal presentations or temporary views.
Example: */

.transition(.scale)

/*Slide Transition:
Use Case: Navigating between views or presenting new content.
Example: */

.transition(.slide)

/*Combined Transitions:
Use Case: Creating more complex animations by combining multiple transitions.
Example: */

.transition(.move(edge: .bottom).combined(with: .opacity))

/* Custom Transitions:
Use Case: Unique scenarios that require specific animations.
Example:*/

/*Is it possible to animate transitions when navigating with NavigationLink?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
Animating Transitions with NavigationLink in SwiftUI
In SwiftUI, the default transition for NavigationLink is a slide animation. However, 
customizing this transition directly is not officially supported. Despite this limitation, 
there are several workarounds and third-party libraries that can help you achieve custom animations.

Key Points to Consider
Default Behavior: NavigationLink uses a slide transition by default.
Custom Navigation: You can create custom navigation systems to apply custom transitions.
Third-Party Libraries: Libraries like NavigationTransitions can help you customize transitions.
Workaround: Custom Navigation System
One way to achieve custom transitions is to create your own navigation system using state management and 
conditional views. This allows you to apply any transition you want.

Example: Custom Fade Transition */

            } else {
                Button("Go to Detail View") {
                    withAnimation {
                        showDetailView = true
                    }
                }
            }
        }

    @State private var appeared: Double = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("This is the detail view")
                .opacity(appeared)
                .onAppear {
                    withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 1.0)) {
                        appeared = 1.0

/* Are there any performance considerations when using custom transitions with NavigationLink?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
Performance Considerations When Using Custom Transitions with NavigationLink
Using custom transitions with NavigationLink in SwiftUI can enhance the user experience, but it's important to consider the potential performance implications. Here are some key points and best practices to keep in mind:

Key Points to Consider
Complexity of Transitions: More complex transitions can be more resource-intensive.
Animation Duration: Longer animations can impact the perceived performance.
Device Capabilities: Performance can vary across different devices, especially older models.
State Management: Efficient state management is crucial to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Performance Tips
Optimize Transition Complexity: Use simpler transitions where possible to reduce the computational load.
Limit Animation Duration: Keep animations short to maintain a responsive user interface.
Profile Performance: Use Xcode's Instruments to profile your app and identify performance bottlenecks.
Conditional Rendering: Ensure that views are conditionally rendered only when necessary to avoid unnecessary computations.

/* Can I have different actions for each button in the navigation bar?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
Handling Different Actions for Each Button in the Navigation Bar
Yes, you can have different actions for each button in the navigation bar in SwiftUI. 
This is achieved by using the Button view within the navigationBarItems or toolbar modifier, 
where each button can have its own action.

Example: Adding Multiple Buttons with Different Actions
Here's a detailed example demonstrating how to add multiple buttons to the navigation bar, 
each with its own action:*/

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Text("Main Content")
                .navigationTitle("Home")
                .navigationBarItems(
                    leading: Button(action: {
                        print("Leading button tapped")
                    }) {
                        Image(systemName: "bell")
                    },
                    trailing: HStack {
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Settings button tapped")
                        }) {
                            Image(systemName: "gear")
                        }
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Add button tapped")
                        }) {
                            Image(systemName: "plus")
                        }
                    }
                )
        }
    }
}
/*Using toolbar Modifier for More Flexibility
The toolbar modifier provides more flexibility and allows you to 
specify the placement of each toolbar item. You can use ToolbarItem and
 ToolbarItemGroup to organize your buttons.

Example: Using toolbar Modifier*/
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            Text("Main Content")
                .navigationTitle("Home")
                .toolbar {
                    ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarLeading) {
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Leading button tapped")
                        }) {
                            Image(systemName: "bell")
                        }
                    }
                    ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Settings button tapped")
                        }) {
                            Image(systemName: "gear")
                        }
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Add button tapped")
                        }) {
                            Image(systemName: "plus")
                        }
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}
/*Best Practices
Avoid Nesting NavigationViews
Nesting NavigationView within another NavigationView can l
ead to unexpected behavior and is generally not recommended. 
Stick to using one NavigationView per view hierarchy.

Example of Correct Usage:*/

import SwiftUI

struct OuterView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            InnerView()
        }
    }
}

struct InnerView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Inner Content")
    }
}
/*Advanced Customization
Customizing the Navigation Bar Appearance
You can customize the appearance of the navigation bar using the 
UINavigationBarAppearance API. This allows you to change the background color, 
title text attributes, and more.*/

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    init() {
        let appearance = UINavigationBarAppearance()
        appearance.configureWithOpaqueBackground()
        appearance.backgroundColor = .systemBlue
        appearance.titleTextAttributes = [.foregroundColor: UIColor.white]
        appearance.largeTitleTextAttributes = [.foregroundColor: UIColor.white]

        UINavigationBar.appearance().standardAppearance = appearance
        UINavigationBar.appearance().scrollEdgeAppearance = appearance
    }

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Text("Main Content")
                .navigationTitle("Home")
                .navigationBarItems(
                    trailing: Button(action: {
                        print("Button tapped")
                    }) {
                        Image(systemName: "plus")
                    }
                )
        }
    }
}
/*Handling Tap Events with Additional Actions
You can also handle more complex actions, such as presenting a modal view 
or navigating to another view, 
when a navigation bar item is tapped.*/

//Example: Presenting a Modal View
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showModal = false

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Text("Main Content")
                .navigationTitle("Home")
                .navigationBarItems(
                    trailing: Button(action: {
                        self.showModal = true
                    }) {
                        Image(systemName: "plus")
                            .imageScale(.large)
                            .frame(width: 44, height: 44, alignment: .trailing)
                    }
                )
                .sheet(isPresented: $showModal) {
                    NavigationView {
                        Form {
                            Text("Modal Content")
                        }
                        .navigationTitle("Create")
                        .navigationBarItems(leading: Button(action: {
                            self.showModal = false
                        }) {
                            Text("Dismiss")
                        })
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
