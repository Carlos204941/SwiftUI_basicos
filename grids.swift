/*Grids are a powerful tool in SwiftUI that allow you to display a 
collection of items in a grid-like structure, similar to the image grids 
you see on social media platforms like Instagram.
Key Components:
Lazy HGrid: A component that arranges items in a horizontal grid.
Lazy VGrid: A component that arranges items in a vertical grid.
Benefits:
Easily create grid-like structures with a few lines of code.
Automatically handles item spacing and alignment.
Supports dynamic content and adaptive layouts.
Use Cases:
Image galleries
Data visualization
Dashboard layouts
Collection views
Example Code: */

import SwiftUI

    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVGrid(columns: [GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: 100))]) {
                ForEach(0..<100) { index in
                    Rectangle()
                        .fill(Color.blue)

/*In this example, we use a LazyVGrid to display a grid of blue rectangles.
The LazyVGrid component takes an array of GridItem objects that define the
layout of the grid. In this case, we use a single adaptive column with a
minimum width of 100 points. The ForEach loop generates 100 rectangles with
a height of 100 points, rounded corners, and padding around each item.
The ScrollView component allows the grid to be scrollable if the content
exceeds the available space.*/

/*LazyVGrid: This is a SwiftUI view that displays a grid of items in a 
vertical arrangement. 
The Lazy prefix indicates that the grid will only create items as needed, 
rather than all at once.
columns: [GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: 100))]: This defines the layout of the grid. I
n this case, it's specifying a single column (because it's an array with one element) 
with the following properties:
.adaptive: This means the column will adapt to the size of its content, rather than 
having a fixed size.
minimum: 100: This sets the minimum size of the column to 100 points. This means that each item 
in the grid will have a width of at least 100 points, but can grow wider if needed.
ForEach(0..<100) { index in ... }: This is a ForEach loop that will iterate over a range 
of numbers from 0 to 99 (because the upper bound is exclusive). For each iteration, 
it will execute the code inside the closure, using the current index as a variable.
In summary:
This code is creating a vertical grid with a single adaptive column that 
will display 100 rectangles (represented by the Rectangle() view). 
Each rectangle will have a minimum width of 100 points, but can grow wider if needed. 
The LazyVGrid will only create the rectangles as they come into view, rather than all at once.
GridItem is a type of object that defines the layout characteristics of a grid column or row. 
In this case, it's being used to define the layout of the single column in the grid.
.adaptive is a method on GridItem that makes the column adapt to the size of its content.
minimum: 100 is a parameter that sets the minimum size of the column to 100 points. */




/*Customizing Rows and Columns in SwiftUI Grids
In SwiftUI, you can customize rows and columns to make them adaptable or dynamic, 
allowing for different layouts on different devices. This is achieved by using the 
GridItem struct and its various initializers.
Adaptive Grids
To create an adaptive grid, you can use the GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: maximum:)) i
nitializer, which allows you to specify a minimum and maximum size for the grid items. 
This way, the grid will adapt to the size of its content and the available space on the screen.
Dynamic Grids
To create a dynamic grid, you can use the GridItem(.flexible(minimum: maximum:)) initializer, 
which allows you to specify a minimum and maximum size for the grid items, 
as well as a flexibility parameter that determines how much space the grid item should take up.
Lazy Grids
By default, grids in SwiftUI are lazy, meaning that only the items that are currently 
on the screen or coming onto the screen are created behind the scenes. 
This optimization helps improve performance by avoiding the creation of unnecessary views.
Example: */


import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVGrid(columns: [

/*Grid Item Types in SwiftUI
In SwiftUI, there are three types of grid items that can be used to specify the size 
and layout of columns:
1. Fixed Grid Item
GridItem(.fixed(size:)
Specifies a fixed size for the column
The size is specified in points (e.g. GridItem(.fixed(100)) for a column with a width of 100 points)
2. Flexible Grid Item
GridItem(.flexible(minimum: maximum:)
Specifies a flexible size for the column
The minimum and maximum sizes are specified in points (e.g. GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 50, maximum: 100)) 
for a column with a minimum width of 50 points and a maximum width of 100 points)
The column will take up as much space as available, within the specified range
3. Adaptive Grid Item
GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: maximum:)
Specifies an adaptive size for the column
The minimum and maximum sizes are specified in points (e.g. GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: 100, maximum: 200)) 
for a column with a minimum width of 100 points and a maximum width of 200 points)
The column will adapt to the size of its content, within the specified range
Using Grid Items
To use grid items, you pass an array of GridItem instances to the LazyVGrid or LazyHGrid initializer. 
For example: */


LazyVGrid(columns: [

    GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: 100, maximum: 200))
]) {
    // Add your grid content here
}GridItem(.adaptive(minimum:50; maximum: 100)),
    GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: 100, maximum: 200))
]) {
    // grid content
}


/*In this example, we create a LazyVGrid with three columns: one fixed column with 
a width of 100 points,
one flexible column with a minimum width of 50 points and a maximum width of 100 points, 
and one adaptive column

ayouts that adjust to the size of the content
and the available space on the screen. */
