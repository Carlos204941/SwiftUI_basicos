/*To introduce alerts in SwiftUI, you can use the alert() modifier, 
which is a straightforward way to present pop-up messages to users. 
Alerts are typically used to convey important information or ask for user input. Below, 
I'll walk you through the process of creating and displaying an alert in SwiftUI, 
including examples for different scenarios.

Step-by-Step Thought Process
State Management: Create a state variable to control the visibility of the alert.
Button to Trigger Alert: Add a button that, when tapped, sets the state variable to true, triggering the alert.
Alert Modifier: Attach the alert() modifier to a view, specifying the title, message, and buttons for the alert.
Customization: Customize the alert with different buttons and roles (e.g., .cancel, .destructive).
Key Points to Consider
State Variable: Use @State to manage the alert's visibility.
Alert Title and Message: Provide meaningful titles and messages to convey the necessary information.
Buttons: Add buttons to the alert for user actions, such as confirming or canceling.
Roles: Use button roles to style buttons appropriately (e.g., .cancel for cancel actions).
Code Implementation
Here are some examples demonstrating how to create and display alerts in SwiftUI:

Basic Alert with a Single Button */

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingAlert = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Alert") {
            showingAlert = true
        }
        .alert("Important message", isPresented: $showingAlert) {
            Button("OK", role: .cancel) { }
        }
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}


// In this example, we create a simple alert with a single button labeled "OK."

// The @State variable showingAlert controls the visibility of the alert.

// When the "Show Alert" button is tapped, showingAlert is set to true, triggering the alert.

// The alert() modifier is attached to the Button view, specifying 
//the title "Important message" and the button "OK" with a .cancel role.

// The alert is dismissed when the "OK" button is tapped.

// You can customize the alert further by adding more buttons, changing the button roles, 
//or providing additional actions.

// Alert with Multiple Buttons

// You can create an alert with multiple buttons to offer users different actions. Here's an example:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingAlert = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Alert") {
            showingAlert = true
        }
        .alert("Important message", isPresented: $showingAlert) {
            Button("Delete", role: .destructive) { }
            Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) { }
        }
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}

//Alert with a Custom Message


import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingAlert = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Alert") {
            showingAlert = true

            Text("Please read this.")
        }
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}


// In this example, we add a custom message to the alert using the message parameter.

// The alert displays the title "Important message" and the message "Please read this."

// You can include additional information or instructions in the alert message to provide more context to users.

// Alert with User Input

// You can also create an alert that prompts users for input. Here's an example using a TextField:

import SwiftUI


struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingAlert = false
    @State private var userInput = ""

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Alert") {
            showingAlert = true
        }
        .alert("Enter your name", isPresented: $showingAlert) {
            TextField("Name", text: $userInput)
            Button("OK") {
                // Handle user input
            }
        }
    }
}


#Preview {
    ContentView()
}

// In this example, we include a TextField in the alert to allow users to enter their name.


// The user input is stored in the @State variable userInput.


// When the "OK" button is tapped, you can handle the user input accordingly.


// You can use this approach to collect user input or display forms within an alert.


// Conclusion

// Alerts are a useful way to communicate important information or interact with users in SwiftUI applications. 
//By following the steps outlined above, you can create and customize alerts to suit your app's needs. 

//Whether you need to display a simple message, offer multiple actions, or collect user input, 
//alerts provide a versatile tool for engaging with users effectively.

/*Explanation
State Variable: The @State variable showingAlert is used to control the visibility of the alert.
Trigger Button: The Button labeled "Show Alert" sets showingAlert to true when tapped, triggering the alert.
Alert Modifier: The alert modifier is attached to the button. It takes a title ("Important message") 
and a binding to the state variable ($showingAlert). 
The alert contains a single "OK" button with a .cancel role.
Summary
In this example, we demonstrated how to implement a basic alert in SwiftUI using the alert modifier. 
The key steps involved:

Creating a state variable to manage the alert's visibility.
Adding a button to trigger the alert.
Using the alert modifier to display the alert with a title and a button.
Best Practices:

Ensure the alert's title and message are clear and concise.
Use appropriate button roles to convey the action's intent.
Use alerts sparingly to avoid disrupting the user experience.
By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively implement 
basic alerts in your SwiftUI applications to communicate important information to users. */

/*How can I add multiple buttons to the alert?
ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL
To add multiple buttons to an alert in SwiftUI, you can use the Alert initializer that allows 
you to specify a primary and secondary button. However, if you need more than two buttons, 
you can use an ActionSheet instead, which provides a similar user experience but supports multiple buttons.

Step-by-Step Thought Process
State Management: Create a state variable to control the visibility of the alert or action sheet.
Trigger Button: Add a button that, when tapped, sets the state variable to true, triggering the alert or action sheet.
Alert with Multiple Buttons: Use the Alert initializer with primary and secondary buttons for up to two buttons.
Action Sheet for More Buttons: Use an ActionSheet for scenarios requiring more than two buttons.
Key Points to Consider
State Management: Use @State to manage the visibility of the alert or action sheet.
Alert vs. Action Sheet: Use Alert for up to two buttons and ActionSheet for more than two buttons.
Button Roles: Use appropriate roles for buttons (e.g., .cancel, .destructive) to convey the action's intent.
Code Implementation
Alert with Two Buttons */

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingAlert = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Alert") {
            showingAlert = true
        }
        .alert("Important message", isPresented: $showingAlert) {
            Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
                print("Delete clicked")
            }
            Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) {
                print("Cancel clicked")
            }
        }
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}


/*In this example, we create an alert with two buttons: "Delete" and "Cancel."

The @State variable showingAlert controls the visibility of the alert.

When the "Show Alert" button is tapped, showingAlert is set to true, triggering the alert.

The alert contains two buttons: "Delete" with a .destructive role and "Cancel" with a .cancel role.

You can customize the buttons' actions and roles based on your app's requirements.

ActionSheet with Multiple Buttons

If you need more than two buttons in an alert-like interface, you can use an ActionSheet. Here's an example:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingActionSheet = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Action Sheet") {
            showingActionSheet = true
        }
        .actionSheet(isPresented: $showingActionSheet) {
            ActionSheet(title: Text("Select an option"), buttons: [
                .default(Text("Option 1")) {
                    print("Option 1 selected")
                },
                .default(Text("Option 2")) {
                    print("Option 2 selected")
                },
                .cancel()
            ])
        }
    }


#Preview {



    ContentView()
}

In this example, we use an ActionSheet to present multiple options to the user.

The @State variable showingActionSheet controls the visibility of the ActionSheet.

When the "Show Action Sheet" button is tapped, showingActionSheet is set to true, triggering the ActionSheet.

The ActionSheet displays a title ("Select an option") and three buttons: "Option 1," "Option 2," and a cancel button.

You can customize the ActionSheet further by adding more buttons, changing the button styles, 
r providing additional actions.

Conclusion

By using the Alert and ActionSheet components in SwiftUI, 
you can create pop-up interfaces with multiple buttons to interact with users effectively.

When you need to present more than two buttons, consider using an ActionSheet to provide a clean and organized user experience.

Experiment with different button configurations, styles, and actions 
to enhance the user interaction in your SwiftUI applications.*/

        case .dataError:
            return "Please try again later."
        }
    }
}


/*Then, use the custom error type in the error alert: */

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingErrorAlert = false
    @State private var error: CustomError?

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Error Alert") {
            error = .networkError

        .alert(isPresented: $showingErrorAlert, error: error) { _ in
            Button("Retry") {
                // Handle retry action
            }
            Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) { }
        } message: { error in
            Text(error.recoverySuggestion ?? "An error occurred.")
        }
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}


/*In this example, we create an error alert using a custom error type (CustomError).

The @State variable showingErrorAlert controls the visibility of the error alert.

When the "Show Error Alert" button is tapped, the error type is set to .networkError, triggering the error alert.

The error alert displays the error description ("Network Error") and a recovery suggestion 
("Please check your internet connection.").

You can customize the error alert further by adding more buttons or actions based on the error type.

Conclusion

Customizing alerts in SwiftUI allows you to provide tailored messages and actions for different scenarios,

such as success notifications, error handling, or user interactions.

By following the steps outlined above and customizing the alert content and buttons,

you can create informative and engaging alerts that enhance the user experience in your SwiftUI applications.*/

/*How can I customize the appearance of an alert in SwiftUI?

ANSWER | GPT-4O MODEL

To customize the appearance of an alert in SwiftUI, you can use modifiers to style the alert's components, 
such as the title, message, and buttons.

Step-by-Step Thought Process

State Management: Create a state variable to control the visibility of the alert.

Trigger Button: Add a button that, when tapped, sets the state variable to true, triggering the alert.

Alert Modifier: Attach the alert modifier to a view, specifying the title, message, and buttons for the alert.

Customizing Appearance: Use modifiers to style the alert's components, such as font, color, and alignment.

Key Points to Consider

State Management: Use @State to manage the alert's visibility.

Alert Content: Customize the title, message, and buttons to fit the app's design and branding.

Modifiers: Apply modifiers to the alert's components to change their appearance and layout.

Code Implementation

Here is an example of customizing the appearance of an alert in SwiftUI:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingAlert = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Alert") {
            showingAlert = true
        }
        .alert("Customized Alert", isPresented: $showingAlert) {
            Button("OK", role: .cancel) { }
        } message: {
            Text("This is a customized alert.")
                .font(.title)
                .foregroundColor(.blue)
        }
        .font(.headline)
        .padding()
        .background(Color.yellow)
        .cornerRadius(10)
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}


In this example, we customize the appearance of the alert by applying various modifiers to its components.

The alert displays the title "Customized Alert" and the message "This is a customized alert."

We use modifiers like font(.title) and foregroundColor(.blue) to style the message text.

Additionally, we apply font(.headline), padding, background(Color.yellow), and cornerRadius(10) 
modifiers to the Button view to customize its appearance.

You can experiment with different modifiers to customize the appearance of the alert, buttons, 
and other components based on your app's design requirements.

Conclusion

Customizing the appearance of an alert in SwiftUI allows you to create visually appealing and engaging user interfaces.

By applying modifiers to the alert's components, you can style the text, buttons, 
and overall layout to match your app's design and branding.

Experiment with different modifiers and combinations 
to achieve the desired look and feel for alerts in your SwiftUI applications.*/

Strategy 2: Single Alert with Identifiable Item
This approach uses an Identifiable item to manage different alerts within a single alert modifier.
This is useful when you have multiple alerts that share similar structures.

First, define a struct to hold alert information:

struct AlertInfo: Identifiable {
    enum AlertType {
        case one
        case two
    }

    let id: AlertType
    let title: String
    let message: String
}
Then, use this struct in your view:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var alertInfo: AlertInfo?

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Show Alert 1") {
                alertInfo = AlertInfo(
                    id: .one,
                    title: "Alert 1",
                    message: "This is the first alert."
                )
            }

            Button("Show Alert 2") {
                alertInfo = AlertInfo(
                    id: .two,
                    title: "Alert 2",
                    message: "This is the second alert."
                )
            }
        }
        .alert(item: $alertInfo) { info in
            Alert(
                title: Text(info.title),
                message: Text(info.message),
                dismissButton: .default(Text("OK"))

//refactoring code

/*Refactoring your SwiftUI code to keep the main body clean and organized is a good practice, 
especially when dealing with alerts. By extracting the alert functionality into a separate function, 
you can make your code more readable and maintainable. Below, I'll guide you through the process of 
refactoring alert code in SwiftUI.

Step-by-Step Thought Process
Define a Custom Alert Function: Create a function that returns an Alert object. This function will 
take parameters for the title, message, and buttons.
Use the Custom Alert Function: Replace the inline alert definitions in your view with calls to the custom alert function.
Maintain State Management: Ensure that the state variables controlling the alert visibility are still managed within the view.
Key Points to Consider
Function Parameters: The custom alert function should accept parameters for the title, message, 
and buttons to allow for flexibility.
State Management: Use @State to manage the visibility of the alert.
Code Reusability: The custom alert function should be reusable across different parts of your application.
Code Implementation
Step 1: Define a Custom Alert Function
First, define a function that creates and returns an Alert object.

/* Conclusion: Alerts are a common and useful way to communicate with users, especially for 
handling errors or conveying success messages. The video concludes by mentioning 
that the next topic to be covered is action sheets, which are similar to alerts

Overall, the video provides a comprehensive guide to implementing and customizing alerts in a SwiftUI app.*/

/*Conclusion

Alerts are a common and useful way to communicate with users in SwiftUI applications. 
They are particularly effective for handling errors, conveying success messages, 
and prompting users for confirmation. By understanding how to implement and customize alerts, 
you can enhance the user experience and ensure that important information is communicated clearly and effectively.

Key Points Covered
Basic Implementation: We started with the basics of implementing alerts using the alert modifier and 
controlling its presentation with a boolean state variable.
Multiple Buttons: We demonstrated how to add multiple buttons to an alert, 
including primary and secondary buttons with different roles.
Customizing Alerts: We explored how to customize alerts for different situations, 
such as errors or success messages, by changing the alert message, adding different buttons, 
and defining actions for the buttons.
Dynamic Alerts: We showed how to create dynamic alerts by changing the title and message 
of the alert based on different scenarios using an Identifiable item.
Using Enums: We illustrated how to use enums to handle different types of alerts, 
making it easy to manage various alert scenarios in a real app.
